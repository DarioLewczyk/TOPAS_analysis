# TOPAS_analysis
## Written by: Dario Lewczyk
* This package is somewhat generalized to run automated Rietveld refinements with the TOPAS6 package through Python.
* Although much of the post-processing is unique to me, the analysis class contains some useful analysis tools including C Matrix parsing and filtering.
* The component tools are generalized and should work with most data without modification.
